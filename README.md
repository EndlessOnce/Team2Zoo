These files were created in Visual Studios and to open up the project please locate the zoodb.sln in the Team2Zoo db repository folder.
If there is an error with one of the bin files then please reference this code to fix the error.
In Visual Studio go into: Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Mangaer Console -> then type in this following code:
Update-Package Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform -r
This will then fix the error provided by the project.
You might need to also download the asp.net sdk for the project to work. I will place the download reference links at the bottom.
