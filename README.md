These files were created in Visual Studios and to open up the project please locate the zoodb.sln in the Team2Zoo db repository folder.
If there is an error with one of the bin files then please reference this code to fix the error.
In Visual Studio go into: Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Mangaer Console -> then type in this following code:
